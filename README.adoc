The main functionality of this project is to track volatility of a cryptocurrencys pair rate (max and min ratio values)
This project was implemented using Vert.x framework and Apache Maven as a build tool.

## Prerequisites

* Apache Maven
* JDK 8+

## How to use/start

* To package and generate jar: ```mvn clean package```
* To start application: ```java -jar target/cryptocurrency-volatility-1.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar```

## Rest API:
To add new currency pair to track use POST REST endpoint ```/cryptos/```:

**Example:**
```
Request:
POST /cryptos/
{
 "ccy1": "ETH",
 "ccy2": "DASH"
}
```
To get min/max rates use GET REST endpoint```/cryptos/:ccy1/:ccy2```:

**Example:**
```
GET /cryptos/ETH/DASH
Response:
{
 "min": 1.345123,
 "max": 1.45223
}
```

## Improvements\TODO

* Unit/integration testing
* Proper error handling
* Validation (incoming requests/responses)
* Add posibility to stop tracking a curreny pair (undeploy verticle)
* Use RxJava
* User Interface
* Authentification
